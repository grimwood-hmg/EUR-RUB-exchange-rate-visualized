# Vizualizing the historical exchange rate of the Euro (EUR) to the Russian Ruble (RUB)

This project attempts to vizualize the change in the exchange rate between EUR and RUB while contextualizing it to Russian military action in Ukraine and international response, i.e. sanctions. The data ranges from 1999 and late May 2022.

I sourced two datasets for this project. One from Kaggle user Daria Chemkaeva. That dataset catalogs historical exchange rates between the Euro and 40 other currencies. That data was sourced from the European Central Bank. The ECB suspended publication of a EUR/RUB reference rate on 2022 March 1. Additional data was sourced from [exchange-rates.org](https://www.exchange-rates.org/)

I cleaned the datasets and exported them to new CSV files and then I plotted them using various Python libraries for the outputs seen in the files 'euro-rub exchange rate vii.jpg' and 'euro-rub exchange rate vii.svg'.
